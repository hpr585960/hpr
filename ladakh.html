<h1>Ladakh is not only Land of Glaciers,<br> But Also the “Glacier Man!”.</h1>

<p>Ladakh is home to the world’s most expert person known for creating artificial glaciers. Chewang Norphel is a native and a retired civil engineer. He had an amazing moment when he witnessed that a small stream close to his home had frozen solid under the cover of trees. After that, he connected himself with watershed development and then created more than 15 artificial glaciers here. The largest glacier created by him is more than 1,000 feet long. It can support an entire village of 700 people and costs only Rs. 90,000.</p>

<h1>Paradise for Astronomers.</h1>

<p>The completely clear skies of Ladakh are devoid of all kinds of pollution, which makes it a paradise for the astronomers. Situated at more than 3,000 meters above sea level, this place enjoys a wonderful view of the sky and turns into an important source for astronomical observations. At 4,500 feet, Indian Institute of Astrophysics features the second highest optical telescope on earth.</p>

<h1>Home to Great Mountain Ranges</h1>

<p>If you think that Ladakh is only home to Himalayas, then you are mistaken. This whole region is located at one of the highest plateaus of the world and known as a junction of two famous mountain ranges - the Himalayas and the Kunlun mountain range. Kunlun deserves the same place in China what Himalayas in India. So, one can be also ready for great mountain views in this place.</p>
